# Project Penney

This repository holds all files needed to run Monte Carlo-style simulations to automate Penney's Game.

## Overview 

Penney's Game is a card game involving two players selecting sequences and attempting to match their sequences to the order of cards in the deck to acheive either the most "tricks" or the most "cards".

## Features
* Creates randomly generated sequences of variable size 
* Efficiently simulates multiple rounds of Penney's game with reshuffled decks of variable size
* Computes cumulative frequencies of both players' wins for different sequence combinations
* Automatically visualizes results with heatmap 

### Files included:

* `main.py`
* `game.py`
* `generate.py`
* `score.py`
* `visualize.py`
